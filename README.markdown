## Readme

I want a nice way to control my LED RGB pixels over my network; therefore, this is a personal project combining two python projects.
1. The webstack is provided by web2py. 

2. The pixel code is provided by Adafruit. 

3. The OS running on my raspberry pi is Occidentals, Adafruit's successor to a derivation of Debian called Wheezy. 

4. The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. Itâ€™s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. (from raspberrypi.org)
